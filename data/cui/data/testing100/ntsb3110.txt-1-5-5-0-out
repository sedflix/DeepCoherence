ntsb3110txt-1-5-5-0-1 While operating in clouds at flight level 290, in an area with thunderstorms and turbulence, the airplane experienced a loss of power in all four engines. 
ntsb3110txt-1-5-5-0-2 Information from the flight data recorder indicated that during descent from flight level 290, an elevator oscillation occurred. 
ntsb3110txt-1-5-5-0-3 The #1 and #2 engines were shut down due to high turbine gas temperatures. 
ntsb3110txt-1-5-5-0-4 The #2 engine was restarted before making an emergency landing at the Des Moines Airport. 
ntsb3110txt-1-5-5-0-5 The captain reported that the airplane had been flown into severe icing conditions. 
ntsb3110txt-1-5-5-0-6 The aircraft flight manual (AFM) prohibited flight in icing conditions above 26,000 feet (except when necessary for descent). 
ntsb3110txt-1-5-5-0-7 Also, the AFM stipulated the minimum engine speeds which needed to be maintained while operating in icing conditions; it also required that the thrust management system (TMS) be disconnected in icing conditions. 
ntsb3110txt-1-5-5-0-8 There were indications that the TMS was disconnected about 230 seconds after engine roll-back began. 
ntsb3110txt-1-5-5-0-9 Additionally, the AFM did not provide accurate information concerning 'in cloud' correction factor for the outside temperature thermometer.
