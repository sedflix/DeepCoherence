ntsb3092txt-1-5-5-0-1 The passenger reported that the flight was delayed a day due to weather, and that she was scheduled to attend a class at the destination the day of the accident. 
ntsb3092txt-1-5-5-0-2 Prior to departure, icing advisories were issued to the pilot for his route of flight; temperatures aloft ranging from -6 to -8 degrees C. The pilot advised the passenger of icing conditions prior to departure, and reassured her they could deviate if those conditions were encountered. 
ntsb3092txt-1-5-5-0-3 During the flight, in IMC at 9,000 feet, the pilot radioed that he had a partial loss of engine power, and requested vectors to the nearest airport. 
ntsb3092txt-1-5-5-0-4 Columbus Approach initially provided a vector to an airport about 12.5 miles northeast, within gliding range. 
ntsb3092txt-1-5-5-0-5 Approach also thought the airport would be VFR, and that the flight would be aided with a tailwind. 
ntsb3092txt-1-5-5-0-6 The flight was then vectored to an airport about 17.5 miles southwest, which was IFR and had several pilot reports of icing conditions. 
ntsb3092txt-1-5-5-0-7 Several minutes later Columbus Approach provided a vector back to the initial airport northeast, followed shortly thereafter by a vector to a third airport about 12.5 miles southeast. 
ntsb3092txt-1-5-5-0-8 The airplane crashed about 6 miles from the third airport. 
ntsb3092txt-1-5-5-0-9 Inspection of the spark plug electrodes revealed a condition consistent with a rich mixture. 
ntsb3092txt-1-5-5-0-10 One half-inch-thick pieces of ice, matching the leading edges of the wings, were observed in the vicinity of the wreckage. 
ntsb3092txt-1-5-5-0-11 The airplane was not approved for icing conditions. 
ntsb3092txt-1-5-5-0-12 The ATC handbook stated that certain weather phenomenon may deserve weighted consideration when recommending an emergency airport; the pilot may elect to fly further to an airport with VFR conditions.
