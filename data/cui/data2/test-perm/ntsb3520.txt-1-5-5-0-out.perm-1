ntsb3520txt-1-5-5-0-1 The commercial air taxi pilot-in-command (PIC) was taking a routine competency flight check from an FAA inspector. 
ntsb3520txt-1-5-5-0-2 The FAA inspector asked the PIC to perform a landing on a turf runway, and to stop short of a designated spot on the field. 
ntsb3520txt-1-5-5-0-3 The pilot made an uneventful landing, but was unable to stop the airplane prior to the designated spot. 
ntsb3520txt-1-5-5-0-4 The airplane continued to roll on the turf runway, but soon encountered a large, unseen, hole about midfield. 
ntsb3520txt-1-5-5-0-5 The nosewheel entered the hole, and the nose landing gear subsequently collapsed. 
ntsb3520txt-1-5-5-0-6 The PIC reported he had received a standard weather briefing via telephone from an FAA Flight Service Station specialist just prior to the flight, but had received no information about the hole in the middle of the runway. 
ntsb3520txt-1-5-5-0-7 A review of the Notices to Airmen (NOTAMs) disclosed an active NOTAM regarding a 24 inch deep, by 6 feet wide hole, midfield of the runway the PIC landed on. 
ntsb3520txt-1-5-5-0-8 This NOTAM was not given to the PIC during his weather briefing as required by the FAA Air Traffic Control procedures manual.
