ntsb3238txt-1-5-5-0-5 She stated that the airplane was 'corkscrewing all the way around, maybe 3 or 4 times, before it went over the tree-line and out of sight.' 
ntsb3238txt-1-5-5-0-6 She further stated that 'one wing was bent 90 degrees in half (at the midway point).' 
ntsb3238txt-1-5-5-0-7 Another witness reported that he saw the airplane coming over the trees with 'something hanging down under the left wing at about the midpoint (like a support brace).' 
ntsb3238txt-1-5-5-0-8 The witness further stated that 'at the same midpoint area of the left wing, he noticed that the leading edge was funny or something was flapping around.' 
ntsb3238txt-1-5-5-0-9 Postcrash examination of the wreckage revealed the left wing leading edge was found crushed aft to the spar at the midpoint and the left wing spray boom was dented/bent approximately 2.5 feet inboard from the outboard end.
