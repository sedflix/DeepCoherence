ntsb4088txt-1-5-5-0-4 The airplane was being operated as a visual flight rules (VFR) cross-country government flight under Title 14, CFR Part 91, when the accident occurred. 
ntsb4088txt-1-5-5-0-5 The airplane was operated by the State of Alaska, Fish and Wildlife Service. 
ntsb4088txt-1-5-5-0-6 The sole occupant, an Alaska State Trooper who held a commercial pilot certificate, but limited to private privileges for single engine sea operations, was fatally injured. 
ntsb4088txt-1-5-5-0-7 Visual meteorological conditions prevailed in the area of the accident, and VFR flight following procedures were in effect. 
ntsb4088txt-1-5-5-0-8 During a telephone conversation with the National Transportation Safety Board investigator-in-charge on June 25, the supervisor for the State of Alaska's aircraft section reported that the accident airplane was one of two airplanes en route to Iliamna, Alaska, after a brief stop at a remote lake.
