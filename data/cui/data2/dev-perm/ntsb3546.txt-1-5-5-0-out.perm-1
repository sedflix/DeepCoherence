ntsb3546txt-1-5-5-0-1 The pilot-in-command (PIC) had just maneuvered the Bell 212 helicopter into a 100 foot hover above a small reservoir to fill a 'Bambi' bucket for fire-fighting operations. 
ntsb3546txt-1-5-5-0-2 The rotorcraft began to settle. 
ntsb3546txt-1-5-5-0-3 The PIC, perceiving that he had encountered rotor vortex conditions, slipped the helicopter to the right with the bucket still in the reservoir. 
ntsb3546txt-1-5-5-0-4 This, in turn, increased the angle of the long line from the vertical or zero degree reference. 
ntsb3546txt-1-5-5-0-5 Immediately thereafter, the PIC noted a loss of power in the #1 engine. 
ntsb3546txt-1-5-5-0-6 He then executed a single-engine autorotation, during which a rotor blade impacted a dead tree. 
ntsb3546txt-1-5-5-0-7 Post-crash examination revealed that the long line had pulled aft and left from its vertical reference into the airframe structure (the 7:30 position of the hell hole in the belly of the helicopter) resulting in 1) the separation of one of the #1 engine push/pull rods, and 2) the deformation of engine control rods associated with the #1 engine flight idle stop (solenoid) which then sheared. 
ntsb3546txt-1-5-5-0-8 The shearing of the flight idle stop resulted in a restriction/cessation of fuel flow to the #1 engine fuel control unit, and subsequent engine shutdown.
