ntsb3998txt-1-5-5-0-1 With a fight instructor, the pilot executed a normal takeoff from Runway 34 for right closed traffic. 
ntsb3998txt-1-5-5-0-2 Because a UH-60 helicopter was executing an approach from the southwest to the threshold of Runway 34, the pilot extend the touchdown point by 1,000 feet. 
ntsb3998txt-1-5-5-0-3 The helicopter transitioned to hovering flight near the threshold, about 30 seconds before the accident airplane. 
ntsb3998txt-1-5-5-0-4 After a short delay, the UH-60 air-taxied to the ramp. 
ntsb3998txt-1-5-5-0-5 When the accident airplane was about 20 feet above the ground, it suddenly rolled right, (faster than a full application of aileron could counteract,) and the right wing contacted the ground. 
ntsb3998txt-1-5-5-0-6 Witness statements place the UH-60, 100 to 600 feet away from the accident airplane at the time of the accident. 
ntsb3998txt-1-5-5-0-7 According to the Aeronautical Information Manual, every aircraft generates vortices, that can cause an uncommanded roll that exceeds the roll-control authority of the encountering airplane. 
ntsb3998txt-1-5-5-0-8 Landing helicopters produce a pair of strong, high-speed trailing vortices similar to larger fixed wing aircraft. 
ntsb3998txt-1-5-5-0-9 Pilots of small aircraft should use caution when operating behind landing helicopters.
